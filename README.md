# cfg2html (Config to HTML)

## Overview

**cfg2html** is a little utility to collect the necessary system configuration files and system set-up to an ASCII file and HTML file. Simple to use and very helpful in disaster recovery situations. cfg2html is written entirely in the native language for system administration: as shell scripts. Experienced users and system admins can adapt or extend the cfg2html scripts to make it work for their particular cases either by using the plugin framework or by modifying the source code.

## Purpose

cfg2html collects the system configuration into an HTML and a text file. cfg2html is the "Swiss Army knife" for the sysadmins. It was written to get all the information needed to plan an update, do basic troubleshooting or performance analysis. As a bonus, cfg2html creates a nice HTML and simple plain ASCII documentation of your system.

This include the collection of Cron and At, installed Hardware, installed Software, Filesystems, Dump- and Swap-configuration, LVM, Network Settings, Kernel, System enhancements and Applications, Subsystems.

## Where to get cfg2html

The first versions of cfg2html were written for HP-UX. Meanwhile the cfg2html HP-UX stream was ported to all major *NIX platforms and small embedded systems. cfg2html works on Linux, HP-UX, SunOS, AIX etc.
