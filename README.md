# cfg2html
cfg2html is a UNIX shell script similar to supportinfo, getsysinfo or get_config, except that it creates a HTML (and plain ASCII) system documentation for HP-UX, SCO-UNIX, AIX, Sun OS and Linux systems. Plug-ins for SAP, Oracle, Informix, Serviceguard, Fiber Channel/SAN, TIP/ix, OpenText (IXOS/LEA), SN Mass Storage like MAS, EMC, EVA, XPs, Network Node Manager and DataProtector etc. are included. The first versions of cfg2html were written for HP-UX. Meanwhile the cfg2html HP-UX stream was ported to all major *NIX platforms and small embedded systems.
