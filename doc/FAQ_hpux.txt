Q: Can the cfg2html report be used in place of nickel. Which of them is more
comprehensive?

A: Bill Hassell • Nickel is completely obsolete. It hasn't been updated for
more than 10 years so it is useless for 11.31 and some of 11.23. cfg2html
comes in two flavors for HP-UX: Version 3.76, the last version for 10.01
through 11.00, and Version 5.25, the latest version for 11.11 and later.

Unlike nickel which packages dozens of files together to make the report,
cfg2html creates just 3 files: html, txt and err. Each file stands alone --
the html file is ready to display with any file browser. The txt file is the
same as the html but without html codes, perfect for searching and scripting
reports on multiple systems. The err file is stderr from various commands,
somewhat useful to see if there any issues. However, many of the error
messages are cause by running non-existent or unconfigured processes and can
be ignored.

cfg2html is 10x more detailed and comprehensive than nickel. It has been used
to manage information for almost 200 servers in one data center, and with a
little scripting, a nice spreadsheet is created with every server, OS version,
model, RAM, CPU count, etc.

  That's a recommended workaround. Also you can force
  the installation.

  Try "downgrading" by:
  swinstall -x allow_downdate=true -s .......

Q1
>Hello, now I'm a new member of that group, but where can i

>email?

A1: No, only when subscribing the first time you will automatic
receive some files we have selected to be send out to new members.
That includes e.g. recent cfg2html for HP-UX and some "ReadMe's".

Q2:
d> I looked in the archives for how to download cfg2html.  It stated
d> there was a "members only" "files" section for downloading.  I do not
d> see these sections. Somehow I received a copy of the HPUX version,

d> exist) I don't mind joining the mailing list, but it would be nice if
d> the download procedure for multiple platforms was clearer. Went to
d> freshmeat.net and had the same encounter.

A2:
You may want to have a look at the file section of
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cfg2html/
That will be
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cfg2html/files/
(you need to login first)

        -------------------------------------------------

Please update to always the latest version before reporting a bug (2.91/2.92 on HPUX).

That's easy: Your diagnostics (stm - support tools manager) hangs. Updated or
fix your diagnostics and your are done. A reboot may fix the problem as well.
If you start mstm on the commandline, you will see that mstm has an error!


> K+T Class Server panic when running cfg2html (cstm)....

Try Patch PHKL_26087 - fixed reboot on our K570/4 HP-UX 11i
(PHKL_26087 is the replacement for PHKL_25552)

PHKL_25552: ( SR:8606219169 CR:JAGad88317 ) The system may HPMC or Data Page
Fault when running the Support Tools Manager (STM) diagnostics "info"
command to retrieve configuration information from HP-PB SE SCSI adapters.
The defect has been observed on both K and T Class systems.


>> In spite of your WARNING, do people use the tool on production systems ?

If you are asking about the HPUX version: It is rock solid, I personally (and my
co-workers) use it on production systems. One warning: If diagnostics is buggy
then you might have a problem. So always make sure you have a good and actual
diagnostic (stm/cstm) version installed. If you expect to have a buggy
diagnostics version you can use the -d commandline option:
-d disable: Diagnostics (cstm #)


>Hi. There appears to be some problem with the download script from your page
>http://members.tripod.de/rose_swe/cfg/cfg.html

Please use http://www.cfg2html.com that redirect you to the new cfg2html
home page. This page doesn't exist anymore!

        -------------------------------------------------

>The script for HP-UX that I download from here is truncated. I have tried it
>several different ways, single click, right click - save as. Always

I heard this issue from several source and therefore decided to put on the
web site a gzip'ed tar archive in the hope that this fixes broken downloads.

        -------------------------------------------------

Thanks for an excellent program! But I have a problem with the
cfg2html.sd depot file:
# swlist -s /home/gratiend/src/cfg2html_hpux_B.1.53.sd
# Initializing...
# Contacting target "ipc1gr07"...
ERROR:   tar: /home/gratiend/src/cfg2html_hpux_B.1.53.sd : This doesn't
         look like a tar archive
ERROR:   tar: /home/gratiend/src/cfg2html_hpux_B.1.53.sd : Skipping to
         next file...
ERROR:   Read from serial depot file failed.  Invalid argument (22).
ERROR:   The INDEX file on the source did not exist or could not be
         read.
ERROR:   "ipc1gr07:/home/gratiend/src/cfg2html_hpux_B.1.53.sd":  An I/O
         error occurred while performing this task.

Is it me? or is there something wrong with the depot (I have the same
behavior on HP-UX 10.20 and 11.0).

> how big is your depot? If around 150 KB, then you have to rename it to *.sd.gz and
> then gunzip it first... you should get then a file around with 500 KB...

Yes,you were right! Thanks.

        -------------------------------------------------

Q>      Hi,
Q>         does anyone know if you can still get the tar distributed version
Q>      of cfg2html - I'm not a great fan of SD dervied stuff as I like to
Q>      stick files where I want them....

A>    you can use tar "tar xvf cfg2html_hpux_B.2.11-BETA.sd cfg2html" to
A>    extract the files from the depot. This will extract only the
A>    cfg2html files from the depot and will place them in a directory
A>    called "cfg2html".
A>    The depot file is a tar-archive including the files for the software
A>    and all information's ("catalog") for swinstall.

Subject:	Cfg2html integration with ServiceControl Manager

Ralph,

   I am a development engineer on the ServiceControl manager product in
   Fort Collins Colorado in the US. If you will take a look at:

	http://software.hp.com/products/SCMGR/

   and follow the "open source tools" link at the left, then look under
   "configuration reporting tools" on this page, you will observe that
   we have provided our customers with a way to integrate Cfg2html with
   ServiceControl Manager. Our manager, Dean Stevenson, learned about
   your product some time ago, and when with release 3.0 of SCM we
   gained the capability to integrate Web Tools with our product, he saw
   the value of combining the two products. Feel free to take a look at
   the result and let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.
   We are always looking for other tools to integrate with SCM, so if
   you have any suggestions for other tools that would fit, please let
   me know. Thanks for your useful tool!

Jon Warden (and the rest of the ServiceControl Manager team)

Configuration reporting tools

   » cfg2html.xml (Linux and HP-UX) These tools collect web pages
   describing the operating system configuration of each managed node on
   the CMS. One tool, Config Collect HPUX, gathers information from HP-
   UX managed nodes. Another tool, Config Collect Linux, gathers
   information from Red Hat Linux managed nodes. Both tools construct an
   index page with links for each managed node. The Config Display tool
   is a web-launch tool that displays the collected configuration
   information in a browser.

   To gather information from Linux managed nodes, the Linux version of
   cfg2html must be installed on the CMS (even if the CMS is an HP-UX
   system). There is no need to install it on the Linux managed nodes.
   To gather information from HP-UX managed nodes, the HP-UX version of
   cfg2html must be installed on the CMS and all the HP-UX managed nodes
   the tool is to run on. If the CMS is a Linux system, the Linux
   version of cfg2html must be installed there.

   These tools are based on the Freeware utility cfg2html, available for
   Linux and HP-UX platforms from htttp://www.cfg2html.com.  Right-click
   on the xml file above and "Save Target As..." to save the file to a
   convenient location.  Once you have downloaded the tool and xml file,
   run '/opt/mx/bin/mxtool -af <filename>'.

   This tool was tested with version 1.87 of cfg2html on HP-UX 11.11,
   and with version 1.7 of cfg2html on Red Hat Linux 7.2.

Q: > Is this "core.pvgfilter.hppa"-problem solved in last (4.84)-depot ?

A: No, thats an 11.23 and 11.31 issue I am currently not able to fix. This is due to the new agile devices and the arise emulator.
The "PVG Filter" section will be skipped in the 5.xx release

Wie wird ein Software Spiegel (Mirror/UX) überprüft?

Dazu eignet sich cfg2html ganz gut:

1.) Schnellüberprüfung, ob Platten defekt sind:  /opt/cfg2html/contrib/check_errors_hpux.sh
    -> stale ???  Spiegel steht/Platte defekt
Idealerweise sollte check_errors_hpux.sh NICHTS zurückmelden, dann ist alles ok!

2.) cfg2html_hpux.sh -t ausführen, dann werden Daten für eine graphische Ausgabe mitgesammelt. Die erzeugte {hostname}.HTML mir zusenden, ich mache dann die graphische Aufbereitung (mittels TGV -> Visio).

Warning: This Dokumentation is outdated, cfg2html had been renamed to cfg2html_hpux.sh
and MakeIndex.shar is now html/make_index.sh

Intranet basierende Onlinedokumentation aller HP-Server
-------------------------------------------------------

Auf zentralem Rechner der per rcp/remsh alle anderen Server ohne Password
erreichen kann:

- #mkdir /home/HP
- #cd /home/HP
- In "/home/HP" die Dateien cfg2html.sh und MakeIndex.shar kopieren
  #chmod 744 cfg2html.sh
  #sh MakeIndex.shar		--> erzeugt u.a. make_index.sh

- #vi hosts     --> hier alle Server eintragen, z.B     server-1
                                                        server-2
                                                          .

           rcp $i:/home/HP/$i.html /home/HP
        done
        make_index.sh

- #chmod 744 do_doku.sh
- #./do_doku.sh
--> jetzt kann man je nach Anzahl der Server erst mal Mittag machen.

- Alle html-Dateien aus /home/HP auf den Web-/Intranetserver kopieren
- Danach im Navigator die Datei "/home/HP/allhosts.htm" öffnen
- Wenn man jetzt eine modifizierte "do_doku.sh" (einige Dinge braucht man ja nur das
  einmal zu machen) in die crontab einbindet und einmal die Woche laufen laesst ist
  die Dokumenation immer up_to_date.

Notes:
cfg2html.sh     sammelt die Konfigurationsinformation und legt folgende Dateien
an
                hostname.html   --> Konfigurationsinformationen im html-Format
                hostname.txt    --> Konfigurationsinformationen als Textdatei
                hostname.err    --> Fehlerlogdatei fuer cfg2html.sh

Make_Index.shar erzeugt das HTML-Frame,
                linkes Fenster hostnamen,
                rechtes Fenster die entsprechenden Konfigurationsinformationen

make_index.sh   generiert die hostliste im linken Frame anhand der vorgefundenen
