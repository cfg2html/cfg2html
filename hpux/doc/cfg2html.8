cfg2html is a little utility to collect the necessary system configuration files and system set-up to an ASCII file and HTML file. Simple to use and very helpful in disaster recovery situations.

.SH NAME
cfg2html \- creates a nice HTML and plain ASCII documentation of your HP-UX, GNU/Linux and *NIX systems. WARNING, use this script AT YOUR OWN RISK.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B cfg2html
.RB [ \-o012vhADFHLSMUPacdefklns ]
.IR option ...
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B cfg2html
collects the system configuration into a HTML and a text file. cfg2html is the “Swiss army knife” for the sysadmins. It was written to get the necessary information to plan an update, to perform basic trouble shooting or performance analysis.

This include the collection of Cron and At, installed Hardware, installed Software, Filesystems, Dump- and Swap-configuration, LVM, Network Settings, Kernel, System enhancements and Applications, Subsystems.

As a bonus
.B cfg2html
creates a nice HTML and plain ASCII documentation. If you like, write your
description of the system into
.B /opt/cfg2html/etc/systeminfo

example:
.TP
  Main database server using special software.
  Contact: Micky Mouse <admin@foo.bar>
  Location: Mars Moon
  Any other CMDB related information
.TP
and so on.

.TP
.B /opt/cfg2html/etc/local.conf
if this file exists, you can add your own OUTPUT_URL location, e.g.
.TP
  OUTPUT_URL=nfs://your-nfs-server/cfg2html-data/
Beneath the path of the cfg2html-data directory sub directories will be created per hostname.
