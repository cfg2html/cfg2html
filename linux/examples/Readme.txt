As a response to issue #202, which was a request for sample output from cfg2html, I have
generated the following files from a non-production/test system having no sensitive information.
As you'll see from the files, the output was generated from a Debian 13 (Trixie) system.

I typically run cfg2html on the 1st and 2nd of the month on a regular basis using different
options.

In the first report, I use it to compare in the *.txt files what has changed over time. In it,
I do not enable columnar output (i.e. the -w option) in this report so the diff command can
more readily visually identify the differences between the files.

The 2nd report is used to manually review the generated configuration info, with output spread
across the screen with the specified number of columns, (e.g. -w 300).  This shortens the report
by thousands of lines which is useful if you're paging through the files.



The files were generated by issuing the following commands using cron.  The command is actually
documented in the .txt and .html files


  /usr/sbin/cfg2html -W            -P -2 \%Y-\%m-\%d-\%H\%M     

This command is issued on the 1st of the month.  It turns on 2 extra options.  Most options
are turned on by default, but the ones shown are normally not.

- the -W option generates additional output in the .err file that lists information about
  commands that cfg2html supports, but are not presently installed on the system.  In other words,
  cfg2html will generate more useful(?) output if one or more of the packages that provides
  these commands are installed on the system.  The reason for the questionable usefulness of
  adding the extra packages is that they may not be relevant for this system.  For example,
  it probably is useless to add commands relating to say borgmatic, if there's no intention of
  doing your system backups using the borg backup package.

- the -P option turns on Plugin processing, which allows you to run your own commands or scripts
  if you are so inclined.

- the -2 option sets up uniquely named report files, as can be seen below in the filelist.



The 2nd set of reports run on the 2nd of the month use this entry in cron:

  /usr/sbin/cfg2html    -w 300  -O    -2 \%Y-\%m-\%d-\%H\%M

- the -w option allows the reports to be somewhat condensed by putting output across the page
  with the specified column width instead of each line of generated output being put onto its
  own line.

- the -O option turns off listing files which have been deleted but are actually still being
  used.  On long-running systems, this list can be quite long, and most often, not found to be
  particularly useful in my experience.  YMMV.


The generated files are:

Of course, any of the specified options can be used together if you wish.  You can also simply
run the commands from the CLI as well for ad hoc reports.

Hopefully, this helps anyone wanting to see sample output from cfg2html without having to
install the software.


Thanks to Ralph for continuing to support cfg2html!
