                    Collect cfg2html data files
                    ---------------------------

To collect the systeminfo data files from several nodes using rsh is very
__insecure__, because root is starting cfg2html. For more information use google
and search for: rsh insecure

I (who?) tried another way.

Machine to collect the data:

1. To collect the data I run on every machine a root cron job to save
   the data to /tmp
2. Copy cfg2html script from the central machine to /tmp (if you say "yes"
   to SCRIPTREMOTE else using a local version).
3. Then copy the files using a secure method under another uid to a
   central machine. I use scp (ssh) to copy the files.
4. Now remove the data and cfg2html files from /tmp

Central machine:

1. create a user to collect the files.
2. Now you can copy from every remote host the collected data to the user's
   home directory or any other directory the user has permission to write.
   See below to setup ssh.
3. I have the cfg2html scripts for all machines for example Linux, HP-UX, sun ..
   located in a central directory, for example ../home/user/cfg2html/bin
   Don't forget the security!

---------------------------------

Do not store the data files in a directory everybody has read permissions.

---------------------------------
ssh remote login without password:

on a client root should run:

ssh-keygen
          enter
          enter
scp $HOME/.ssh/identity.pub user@central-host:/home/user/
now you must enter the password for user the last time :-)

user at the central-host:
cat identity.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
now the user "root" from a client machine can login without password.
