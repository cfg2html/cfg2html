Description: Collects a Linux system configuration into a HTML and a text file.
 cfg2html=Config to HTML is the "Swiss army knife" for the ASE, CE, sysadmin
 etc. We wrote it to get the necessary information to plan an update,
 to perform basic trouble shooting or performance analysis.
 As a bonus cfg2html creates a nice HTML and a plain ASCII documentation from
 your Linux systems, collecting cron and at, installed hardware, installed software,
 file systems, dump- and swap configuration, LVM, network settings,
 kernel, system enhancements and applications subsystems.
