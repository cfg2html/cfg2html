cfg2html is a little utility program that can be used to collect the necessary system configuration files and system set-up information to both an ASCII and an HTML file. Simple to use and very helpful when preparing for disaster recovery situations.

.SH NAME
cfg2html \- creates nice HTML and plain ASCII documentation of your GNU/Linux
systems.
.TP
.B WARNING, use this script AT YOUR OWN RISK.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B cfg2html
.RB [ \-oshxOcSTflkenaHLvhpPA210]
.IR option ...
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B cfg2html
collects the system configuration details into a webpage and a text file. cfg2html is the “Swiss army knife” for sysadmins. It was written to get the necessary information to plan an update, to perform basic troubleshooting or do performance analysis.

This includes the collection of Cron and At jobs, installed Hardware, installed Software, Filesystems, Dump- and Swap-configuration, LVM, Network Settings, Kernel, System enhancements and Applications, and Subsystems.

.br
If you like, you can add a
description of the system into
.B /etc/cfg2html/systeminfo

example:
.TP
  Main database server using special software.
.TP
  Contact: Micky Mouse <admin@foo.bar>
.TP
  Location: Mars Moon
.TP
and so on.
.P
If file
.B /etc/cfg2html/files
exists, you can add your own list of files to collect - see example included.

.SS Switches
The following switches are available from the command line:
.TP
.B \-o
.IR dir
.br
Override the default Logfile output location for the generated HTML and text output (e.g.
.B /var/log/cfg2html
) to the specified directory
.br
Alternatively, you can specify the location of the logfile by setting the environment
variable
.B OUTDIR="/path/to/dir"
.br
Specifying the
.B \-o
option supercedes the definition of the OUTDIR environment variable

.TP
.B \-0
append the datestamp to the Logfile (OUTDIR) with format Day-Month-Year-HourMinute, e.g. 28-Oct-2020-2212

.TP
.B \-1
append the datestamp to the Logfile (OUTDIR) with format Day-Month-Year, e.g. 28-Oct-2020

.TP
.B \-2
append the datestamp to the Logfile (OUTDIR) with the date format of your own choosing. e.g specifying
.B %Y%m%d-%H%M
would append the date with a format of 20201028-2212 to the log file name.

.TP
.B \-v
output cfg2html version information, kernel information and exit

.TP
.B \-h
output usage information and exit

.P
By default, information in each of the following categories will be collected.  Use the following options to disable the collection of the indicated configuration information:

.TP
.B \-s
disable: System
.TP
.B \-c
disable: Cron
.TP
.B \-S
disable: Software
.TP
.B \-f
disable: Filesystem
.TP
.B \-l
disable: LVM
.TP
.B \-k
disable: Kernel
.TP
.B \-e
disable: Enhancements
.TP
.B \-n
disable: Network
.TP
.B \-a
disable: Applications
.TP
.B \-H
disable: Hardware
.TP
.B \-x
disable listing the executable files in the PATH
.br
This switch has no effect if -s is specified.
.TP
.B \-O
disable listing open files that have been deleted
.br
This switch has no effect if -s is specified.
.TP
.B \-A
disable collecting the Altiris ADL Agent files, if present

.P
Other options

.TP
.B \-p
enable collecting the system's Log files.  If running on an HP PROLIANT SERVER, collect additional relevant logs.
.TP
.B \-P
enable the processing of the custom plugins that you may have configured
.TP
.B \-L
disable showing the command that was executed to generate the html output in each section
.TP
.B \-T
enable showing performance information regarding the execution of cfg2html

.SH VARIABLES

.TP
.B OUTDIR
defines the folder where the generated reports are saved.  The -o switch
overrides the setting of this environment variable.
.br
A useful technique is to specify it on the command line when executed. E.g.
.br
OUTDIR=/path/to/dir ./cfg2html
.br
Note that using the -0 -1 or -2 switches append the indicated date stamp to the log files created in OUTDIR.

.TP
.B LOCALPATH
If not specified, cfg2html will by default display all of the executable files in the deemed to be optimal
PATH as stated in
.br
.I http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/117535/ordering-of-the-path-environment-variable
.br
defined at the beginning of the path, followed by specific additional directories that cfg2html has found to be installed.
.br
.B LOCALPATH
provides a means for the Sysadmin to specify the PATH for which they want to see the contents.  If defined, the variable should
be set to a colon-separated list of directories, which do not need to exist.
.br
e.g. LOCALPATH=/operator/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
.br
The best location for setting this variable is in
.br
/etc/cfg2html/local.conf
.br
but like
.B OUTDIR,
can also be specified on the command line, if so desired.

.SH FILES
After installation, the following files will exist:

.TP
.B /usr/sbin/cfg2html
The main program wrapper script

.TP
.B /usr/share/cfg2html
Contains the main linux script along with other supporting files

.TP
.B /etc/cfg2html/systeminfo
The system description you can update

.TP
.B /etc/cfg2html/files
The contents of the files listed will be collected into the report

.TP
.B /etc/cfg2html/local.conf
Can contain local switch over-rides and local variable definitions
.br
See
.B /usr/share/cfg2html/etc/default.conf
for default settings

.TP
.B /usr/share/man/man8/cfg2html.8.gz
The man page.

.TP
After cfg2html is run, the following files will be generated in OUTDIR:
.br

.TP
.B <hostname>.html
the generated documentation in HTML form

.TP
.B <hostname>.txt
the generated documentation in ASCII form

.TP
.B <hostname>.err
error logfile (if any errors are generated)

.SH NOTES
Only
.B root
can run the
.B cfg2html
wrapper script.
.br
For security reasons, it is best to store the HTML and ASCII
files in a safe place where only the root user has access, or remove the files from
your file system.
