= CONFIG TO HTML (cfg2html)

Cfg2html is a UNIX shell script similar to supportinfo, getsysinfo or get_config,
except that it creates a HTML (and plain ASCII) system documentation for HP-UX
10.xx/11.xx, Integrity Virtual Machine, SCO-UNIX, AIX, Sun OS and Linux systems.
Plug-ins for SAP, Oracle, Informix, HP MC/Serviceguard, Fiber Channel/SAN,
TIP/ix, OpenText (IXOS/LEA), SAN Mass Storage like MAS, EMC, EVA, XPs, Network
Node Manager and DataProtector etc. are included. The first versions of cfg2html
were written for HP-UX. Meanwhile the cfg2html HP-UX stream was ported to all
major *NIX platforms and small embedded systems.

Some consider it to be the Swiss army knife for the Account Support Engineer,
Customer Engineer, System Admin, Solution Architect etc. Originally developed to
plan a system update, it was also found useful to perform basic troubleshooting
or performance analysis. The production of nice HTML and plain ASCII
documentation is part of this utility.
