# This is a Veritas Cluster Services Plugin for cfg2html written by
# by ROSE SWE, http://www.cfg2html.com. I found this utility so useful that
# I spent a few hours after a peoplesoft outage in the office sorting out 
# VCS Support. I hope this code is of as much use to others as it was to me.
# Written and tested on Sun Solaris 8/9 for Veritas Cluster 3.5 --> 4.1
# Keiran Sweet - Hutchison Telecoms Australia
# < Keiran at gmail . com >
# Current Release: 1.0 - Initial Release - May 13 2005
# Still to be Done:
# - HP-UX Testing - I havent had the time to test this on VCS/HP 
# - More features - Give me feedback/info on how this can be improved
