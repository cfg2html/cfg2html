READ ME for Cfg2Html (c) by ROSE SWE, Dipl.-Ing. Ralph Roth

cfg2html is the short for "Config to HTML".

Cfg2html is a UNIX shell script similar to check_config or get_config, except
that it creates a HTML (and plain ASCII) system documentation for HP- UX
10.xx/11.xx, SCO-UNIX, AIX, Sun OS and Linux systems. Plug-ins for SAP, Oracle,
Informix, MC/SG, Fibre Channel/SAN, TIP/ix, Mass Storage like EVA3000/EVA5000,
XP48/256/512/1024, Network Node Manager and OmniBack/DataProtector etc. are
included. The first versions of cfg2html were written for HP-UX. Meanwhile the
cfg2html 1.xx HP-UX stream was ported to major *NIX platforms. 

This is the "Swiss army knife" for the Account Support Engineer, Customer
Engineer, sysadmin etc. I wrote it to get the necessary information to plan an
update, to perform basic troubleshooting or performance analysis. As a bonus
cfg2html creates a nice HTML and plain ASCII documentation. If you are missing
something, let us know it!
